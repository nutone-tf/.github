# Nutone

## What is Nutone?

Nutone is a project that aims to be a new, fast and lightweight implementation of the (no longer developed) [ToneAPI](https://github.com/ToneAPI). This project is currently a work in progress.

The Nutone project is split into four repositories:
- the [nutone-api](https://github.com/nutone-tf/nutone-api) repository containing the backend and database for Nutone.
- the [nutone-server](https://github.com/nutone-tf/nutone-server) repository containing the Northstar serverside mod that sends data from verified servers to the Nutone database.
- the [nutone-client](https://github.com/nutone-tf/nutone-client) repository containing the Northstar clientside mod for viewing data from the Nutone database.
- the [nutone-frontend](https://github.com/nutone-tf/nutone-frontend) repository containing the frontend for checking your stats collected by Nutone.

Additionally, the [nutone-docs](https://github.com/nutone-tf/nutone-docs) repository contains documentation, including: how to set up, data collected, etc.


## What does it do?

Nutone collects player statistics from Northstar servers with the [nutone-server](https://github.com/nutone-tf/nutone-server) mod installed. These can be viewed at https://nutone.okudai.dev/
