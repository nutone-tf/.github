# Nutone

## What is Nutone?

Nutone is a project that aims to be a new, fast and lightweight implementation of the (no longer developed) [ToneAPI](https://github.com/ToneAPI). This project is currently a work in progress.

The Nutone project is split into three repositories:
- the [nutone-api](https://github.com/nutone-tf/nutone-api) repository containing the backend and database for Nutone.
- the [nutone-server](https://github.com/nutone-tf/nutone-server) repository containing the Northstar serverside mod that sends data from verified servers to the Nutone database.
- the [nutone-client](https://github.com/nutone-tf/nutone-client) repository containing the Northstar clientside mod for viewing data from the Nutone database.
